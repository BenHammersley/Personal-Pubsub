Installation instructions.

1) Ensure you have Perl on your server.

2) Install the following modules:

Frontier::Client
Frontier::RPC2
HTTP::Daemon
HTTP::Date;

3) Create a directory on your server for the PubSub code to go into.

4) CHMOD this directory to be writable.

5) Upload the pubSub scripts into this directory.

6) Edit each of the scripts, changing the User Definable Variables (you'll see them)

The most important one is the line reading "my $subscriberlistpath	= "notifyServer.txt";"

Change this to the path to "notifyServer.txt" - eg my $subscriberlistpath	= "/usr/local/pubsub/notifyServer.txt";

7) Add the cloud tag to your RSS feed, as per the explanation here:


A <cloud> has five required attributes: 

domain is the domain name or IP address of the cloud, 
port is the TCP port that the cloud is running on, 
path is the location of its responder, 
registerProcedure is the name of the procedure to call to request notification - in the case of PersonalPubSub, this is "pleaseNotify" 
and protocol is xml-rpc, soap or http-post, indicating which protocol is to be used - in the case of PersonalPubSub, this is "xml-rpc"


Example:

<cloud domain="gbloogle.benhammersley.com" port="8888" path="/RPC2" registerProcedure="pleaseNotify" protocol="xml-rpc" />


8) Set the cron to run pubSubStrimmer.pl every hour

9) Set the pubSubListener running. I like to do this with the line

nohup perl pubSubListener.pl

and then killing the terminal window. But that's just me.

10) That's it.
